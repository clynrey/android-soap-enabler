# Welcome on Android SOAP Enabler project #

## What is Android SOAP Enabler project? ##

<p align='justify'>
Android SOAP Enabler project is an effort to enable Android application to make SOAP Web Services call over the air. It was originally developed as an internal tool by the technical department of <a href='http://www.norsys.fr'>Norsys, a french IT service company</a>, and used in several Android application development projects.<br>
</p>

## Why should I use Android SOAP Enabler? ##

<p align='justify'>
<ul><li>Your Android application has to interact with SOAP Web Services through HTTP or HTTPS. You can exploit the WSDL Service contract to build the necessary stuff to exchange data between the application and the server.<br>
</li><li>You do not have a lot of time to implement the network call and an automated code generator will increase productivity when the WSDL contract has to change.<br>
</li><li>This software is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License so you can use it in your application regardless of its license.<br>
</li><li>You are free to improve this project by <a href='mailto:android-soap-enabler-team@googlegroups.com'>contacting the Android SOAP Enabler development team</a>, we're waiting for your feedback :)<br>
</p></li></ul>

## Why should I NOT use Android SOAP Enabler? ##

<p align='justify'>
<ul><li>Because of the XML verbosity, SOAP Web Services are not the best way to connect mobile application, we suggest you to take a look at a best approach like ReST because Android include an HTTP client and JSON parser.<br>
</li><li>Because this free software is distributed without any warranties and your are scared with that.<br>
</p></li></ul>

## What is Android SOAP Enabler? ##

<p align='justify'>
<ol><li>It is a runtime library you'll have to include in your application project<br>
</li><li>It is a code generation tool you'll use to generate the stub code your application will use to interact with the server in addition with the runtime library<br>
</li><li>It is a MOJO, an Apache Maven Plugin, to easily integrates the code generation process into the project life cycle for projects managed by <a href='http://maven.apache.org'>Apache Maven</a>
</li><li>It is an Apache Ant task to easily integrates the code generation process into project managed by <a href='http://ant.apache.org'>Apache Ant</a>
